We at Mazda design and build vehicles with complete customer satisfaction in mind.\\n\\nTo help ensure enjoyable and trouble-free operation of your Mazda, read this manual carefully and follow its recommendations.\\n\\nAn Authorized Mazda Dealer knows your vehicle best. So when maintenance or service is necessary, that's the place to go.\\n\\nOur nationwide network of Mazda professionals is dedicated to providing you with the best possible service.\\n\\nWe assure you that all of us at Mazda have an ongoing interest in your motoring pleasure and in your full satisfaction with your Mazda product.\\n\\nMazda Motor Corporation HIROSHIMA, JAPAN\\n\\nImportant Notes About This Manual Keep this manual in the glove box as a handy reference for the safe and enjoyable use of your Mazda. Should you resell the vehicle, leave this manual with it for the next owner.\\n\\nAll specifications and descriptions are accurate at the time of printing. Because improvement is a constant goal at Mazda, we reserve the right to make changes in specifications at any time without notice and without obligation.\\n\\nEvent Data Recorder This vehicle is equipped with an event data recorder. In the event of a crash, this device records data related to vehicle dynamics and safety systems for a short period of time. These data can help provide a better understanding of the circumstances in which crashes and injuries occur and lead to the designing of safer vehicles.\\n\\nAir Conditioning and the Environment Your Mazda's genuine air conditioner is filled with HFC134a (R134a), a refrigerant that has been found not to damage the earth's ozone layer. If the air conditioner does not operate properly, consult an Authorized Mazda Dealer.\\n\\nPerchlorate Certain components of this vehicle such as [air bag modules, seat belt pretensioners, lithium batteries, ...] may contain Perchlorate Material– Special handling may apply for service or vehicle end of life disposal. See www.dtsc.ca.gov/hazardouswaste/perchlorate.\\n\\nPlease be aware that this manual applies to all models, equipment and options. As a result, you may find some explanations for equipment not installed on your vehicle.\",\n",
